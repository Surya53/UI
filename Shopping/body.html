          liquor brand Royal Challenge.Since its inception, the team has played its home matches at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.

        The Royal Challengers have never won the IPL but finished runners-up on three occasions between 2009 and 2016. 
        Their lack of success over the years despite the presence of various notable players has earned them the tag of "underachievers".[2][3]
         The team holds the records of both the highest and the lowest totals in the IPL – 263/5 and 49 respectively.
